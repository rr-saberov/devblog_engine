            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (whi
            ch has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component o
            f Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines,
             and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
              compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its
              Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine,
              however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used
              by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions."/>

            is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
            Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library
            depends on the Java Class Library,[3] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
            Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React[4])
             or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.[5]
            Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.[6]
            On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.
           [7] Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler."/>

              garbage collection, structural typing,[5] and CSP-style concurrency.[12]
              The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name
              , golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[13]
            There are two major implementations:
            Google's self-hosting[14] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, and WebAssembly.[15]
            gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the libgo library. With GCC the combination is gccgo;[16]

            <column name="title" value="post about TypeScript"/>
            <column name="text" value="TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
             It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
             TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5]
              As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
              TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno).
               There are multiple options available for transcompilation.
                Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[6] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
            TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header
            files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files
            as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js.
            TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.[7]
            The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache
            License 2.0. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later,
            alongside C# and other Microsoft languages.[8] An official extension allows Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well.
             Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript. "/>
